## UI DEVELOPMENT CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

**BEER CSS PHILOSOPHY - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:**
1. **ALWAYS use Beer CSS semantic classes and helpers FIRST** - Never custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
2. **Follow Beer CSS patterns exactly** - Don't fight the framework with custom overrides
3. **Read beercss.md before ANY UI changes** - It contains specific patterns and anti-patterns
4. **Use semantic HTML structure** - Beer CSS expects proper HTML elements (nav, header, menu, etc.)
5. **Leverage helpers** - Use spacing, positioning, and layout helpers instead of custom CSS
6. **Test with framework, not against it** - Work with Beer CSS patterns, don't override them

**ALWAYS verify UI changes in Simple Browser before claiming success:**
1. For ANY UI change, use `open_simple_browser` to view the actual result
2. Do NOT claim changes work without visual verification 
3. Do NOT apply layers of CSS fixes without identifying root cause
4. ALWAYS observe current state first, then iterate systematically
5. When user reports UI issues, inspect the actual rendered output immediately

**Example workflow:**
- User reports "Monaco is dark theme"
- FIRST: Open simple browser to see current state
- IDENTIFY: Which component is actually being used (Monaco vs SimpleEditor)
- FIX: Make targeted change to correct component
- VERIFY: Refresh browser to confirm fix worked

## Project Context

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
	- Confirmed: .github/copilot-instructions.md exists.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	- Project: SvelteKit dashboard authoring app, no TypeScript, uses ECharts via svelte-echarts, Monaco editor, drawer navigation, compile-on-save, file-based dashboard storage.

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	- SvelteKit project scaffolded in current directory using Vite and Svelte template.

- [ ] Customize the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.
	Develop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
	Apply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
	Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.
	-->

- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- ONLY install extensions provided mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed. -->

- [ ] Compile the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Install any missing dependencies.
	Run diagnostics and resolve any issues.
	Check for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.
	-->

- [ ] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.
	 -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.
	 -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.
	Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Codeâ€”do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
